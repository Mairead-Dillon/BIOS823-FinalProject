# BIOS823-FinalProject
GitHub repository for the BIOSTAT 823 final project.

The code contained in this GitHub repository trains a neural network with two layers. The first data set trained and tested on using the neural network predicts whether or not a patient has diabetes based on the patient's number of prior pregnancies, glucose level in blood, blood pressure measurement, thickness of skin, insulin level in blood, body mass index, diabetes percentage, and age.

To use this code the pandas and numpy libraries must be imported into python.
